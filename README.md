# DataScienceProjects
This is a simple program in Python that merges two data sets into a single data set.
After merging, the data set is sorted based on the Company name and the age range.
The source code has been tested on Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, and the Linux system offered by KU.

To run from the terminal: python3 Project1.py
